  st.markdown("""### Our paper
  Color centers in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) have become an intensively researched system due to their potential\
   applications in quantum technologies. There has been a large variety of defects being fabricated, yet, for many of \
   them, the atomic origin remains unclear. The direct imaging of the defect is technically very challenging, in particular\
     since, in a diffraction-limited spot, there are many defects and then one has to identify the one that is optically\
     active. Another approach is to compare the photophysical properties with theoretical simulations and identify which \
     defect has a matching signature. It has been shown that a single property for this is insufficient and causes misassignments.\
      Here, we publish a density functional theory (DFT)-based searchable online database covering the electronic structure \
      of hBN defects (257 triplet and 211 singlet configurations), as well as their photophysical fingerprint (excited state lifetime,\
       quantum efficiency, transition dipole moment and orientation, polarization visibility, and many more). All data \
       is open-source and publicly accessible at https://h-bn.info and can be downloaded. It is possible to enter \
       the experimentally observed defect signature and the database will output possible candidates which can be narrowed\
        down by entering as many observed properties as possible. The database will be continuously updated with more defects \
        and new photophysical properties (which can also be specifically requested by any users). The database therefore \
        allows one to reliably identify defects but also investigate which defects might be promising for magnetic field \
         sensing or quantum memory applications.
