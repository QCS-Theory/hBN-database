            While the ground-state configuration can be obtained by default Gaussian smearing, the excited-state \
            one needs manual electron occupation from the so-called $\Delta$SCF method $[5]$. With this \
            constraint method, both spin-up and spin-down transitions were considered. The hBN monolayer was \
            treated by adding the vacuum layer with 15 $\\text{\AA}$ separated from the neighboring repeated cell to exclude \
            layer-layer interaction. All defects were in turn added at the center of  7$\\times$7$\\times$1 supercell \

            fixing the cell until the total energy and all forces were converged at 10$^{-4}$ eV and 10$^{-2}$ eV/$\\text{\AA}$, \
            respectively. Spin configurations; singlets, doublets, and triplets, were constrained by the difference in \

            A single dominant peak observed in the experimental photoluminescence is related to the zero-phonon line (ZPL). \
            This ZPL is defined as the transition without phonons involved. As such, this can be computed from the total \
            energy difference between the ground and excited configurations. It is worth noting that the zero-point energy \
            is canceled out by the ground and excited configurations. As noted earlier, the spin pathway between spin up \
            and down is considered separately to conserve the radiative transition; this results in two ZPLs for certain defects if both spin transitions exist.

    Excitation and emission polarizations can be extracted from the transition dipole calculation. In principle, the polarizations \
    were orthogonal to their dipoles; hence, both dipoles were rotated by 90$^\circ$ and taken modulo 60$^\circ$ to obtain \
    the nearest angle to the crystal axis. Although the hexagonal lattice is spaced 120$^\circ$, after 180$^\circ$, the \
    angle from the crystal axis will be identical. To make the theoretical polarization compatible with polarization-resolved \
    PL experiments, both dipoles were projected onto the $xy$-plane to compute the in-plane polarization visibility.\n

    In order to calculate the dipoles, the wavefunctions after structural optimization can be extracted using the\
    PyVaspwfc Python code $[6]$. This also implies that the wavefunctions between ground states and excited states \
    are not necessarily the same. This leads to two types of dipoles; excitation and emission dipoles. The former is \
    responsible for the transition from the wavefunction of the most stable ground states to the wavefunction of excited \
    state without geometry relaxation. Meanwhile, the latter describes the transition from the wavefunction of the \
    most stable excited state to the wavefunction of the most stable ground state. This relation can be expressed as

    doublet, and triplet. we found 95 out of 158 defects acting as triplet/singlet states under the neutral-charge state, \
    while the rest preferred the doublet state. For these doublet defects, they will be charged with $\pm 1$ charges. This \
    guarantees that every defect can behave as triplet and singlet configurations. The structures of both total spins are, \
    in turn, optimized, and this can be treated as a ground state. For an excited state, the electrons are manually occupied using \
    the $\Delta$SCF approach. Taking into account the electronic transitions separately, for instance, from spin up to up or from spin \
    down to down, this yields 257 triplet electronic structures for ground states, 257 triplet electronic structures for excited states,\

st.header("3. Defect identification procedure")
with st.container(border=False):
  st.markdown('''
      The database offers multiple options for practical exploration of defect properties. For effective defect identification,\
       it is important to recognize the limitations of DFT to ensure promising defects are not inadvertently overlooked. Accordingly, \
       the step-by-step procedure is described below.

      1. One underlying experimental observation is the zero phonon line (the most prominent peak from the photoluminescence spectrum). \
      This property is directly accessible in the database; however, it is recommended to furnish a range rather than a specific value. \
      This entails conducting a search within a range of  $\pm$0.4 eV from the observed ZPL. The finite accuracy of DFT and residual strain \
      from the experiment justify this range, rendering it incompatible with the unstrained defects documented in the database.
      
      2. While the ZPL range serves as a reliable indicator, additional insights can be obtained from the fabrication technique as well. For instance, \
      if a defect is fabricated using ion implantation, we can infer certain defects based on the ions employed. Meanwhile, defects formed through the\
       use of a scanning electron microscope are inclined to be carbon-related defects emerging as a result.
      
      3. Then, we can further narrow down the potential defect candidates by considering other photophysical properties such \
      as lifetime, polarization orientation, etc. As explained earlier, the lifetime from DFT can be different from the experimental \
      value due to the purcell effect; however, the order of magnitude is still compatible.

      4. Comparing several parameters between the database and experiments is expected to yield the right defect promising for the experiment. The database \
      will be frequently updated with new defects and new defect properties. In addition, users can also request specific data (defects or properties) which \
      will be prioritized for the next update.
